# Flight Prediction Project
## Overview
This Flight Prediction Project aims to predict flight delays using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering techniques. By leveraging historical flight data, we can develop a model that helps anticipate potential delays, allowing airlines and passengers to better plan and manage their schedules.
